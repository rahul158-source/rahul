            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                SynapSound is a groundbreaking project that leverages brainwave technology
                to create an intuitive and seamless interaction between humans and devices.
                By using EEG (electroencephalogram) sensors, the device can interpret brain
                signals and translate them into commands, allowing users to control various
                devices with their thoughts.
